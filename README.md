# GPSR
Implementation of GPSR protocol (including exceptional case)

Wireless sensor networks consist of small nodes with sensing, computation, and wireless communications capabilities. Many routing, power management, and data dissemination protocols have been specifically designed for WSNs where energy awareness is an essential design issue. Routing protocols in WSNs might differ depending on the application and network architecture. We describe Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR), a novel routing protocol for wireless datagram networks that uses the positions of routers and a packet’s destination to make packet forwarding decisions. GPSR makes greedy forwarding decisions based on only information about a router’s immediate neighbours in the network topology. When a packet reaches a region where greedy forwarding is impossible, the algorithm recovers by routing around the perimeter of the region. In this project, I have implemented the gpsr protocol in Castalia by creating a topology of my own. The protocol failed in certain conditions that are called the perimeter mode. I have created the code for the perimeter which made the routing of packets successful in all the assumed conditions.
